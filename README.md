# quarantineJamSusu

Started this project for the 48h GameJam with the theme "Pack".

The "game" is a simple flock of some cute balls that idle around another or move around on your command (if you click the left mouse button). 

I wanted to implement some interesting flock movement which succeeded. This was also my first (pixelart) game in Unity so it was mostly for learning the basics of Unity work-flow, camera movement, animation etc.
